# TodoList

Simple todo list manager

This is a course assignment for development in C#.

Description of the assignment below.

# Project Brief

Your task is to build a todo list application. The application will allow a user to create new tasks,
assign them a title and due date, and choose a project for that task to belong to. They will need
to use a text based user interface via the command-line. Once they are using the application,
the user should be able to also edit, mark as done or remove tasks. They can also quit and save
the current task list to file, and then restart the application with the former state restored. The
interface should look similar to the mockup below:

# Requirements

The solution must achieve the following requirements:

- Model a task with a task title, due date, status and project
- Display a collection of tasks that can be sorted both by date and project
- Support the ability to add, edit, mark as done, and remove tasks
- Support a text-based user interface
- Load and save task list to file

The solution may also include other creative features at
your discretion in case you wish to show some flair.
